# Smart_Glove_for_Blinds
So this a smart glove actully for blind people this is an very usefull device for them as it helps them bypassing huddles in their way. If we talk about the cost of this product so generally these kind of products cost around 3000-4000 but we have added the most important feature to it for blind people and reduced its cost to only 350Rs.<br>
We have such a big market to sell this product also the feasiblity of this thing is 100%<br>
Their are so many innovative thing done for deaf and dumb people but still no work has been done for visually bling people so i have thought to do something for them which is the usp of this project.

<b>Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04</b><br>

The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor uses sonar to determine distance to an object like bats do. It offers excellent non-contact range detection with high accuracy and stable readings in an easy-to-use package. From 2cm to 400 cm or 1” to 13 feet. It operation is not affected by sunlight or black material like Sharp rangefinders are (although acoustically soft materials like cloth can be difficult to detect). It comes complete with ultrasonic transmitter and receiver module.

<b>Features</b>
• Power Supply :+5V DC<br>
• Quiescent Current : <2mA<br>
• Working Current: 15mA<br>
• Effectual Angle: <15°<br>
• Ranging Distance : 2cm – 400 cm/1" - 13ft<br>
• Resolution : 0.3 cm<br>
• Measuring Angle: 30 degree<br>
• Trigger Input Pulse width: 10uS<br>
• Dimension: 45mm x 20mm x 15mm<br>

<b>Arduino with HC - SR04 Sensor</b><br>
This sensor is really cool and popular among the Arduino Tinkerers. So We've decided to make a project example using this sensor. In this project the ultrasonic sensor read and write the distance in the serial monitor. It's really simple. My goal is to help you understand how this sensor works and then this example can be used for different projects.<br>
